Dutch electricity generation, imports and exports. Data from <a

<p style="width:80%">
Many websites <a href="https://energieopwek.nl">provide pretty</a> and seemingly
<a href="https://co2monitor.nl/">comprehensive data</a> about Dutch
electricity production and consumption. Almost all of these sites report
data from the same <a href="https://www.netanders.nl/">predictive
model</a> (owned by Dutch national gas company Gasunie). Since <a
href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/dutch-electrical-power-figures-2/">official Dutch
electricity statistics are not very complete</a>, a lot of assumptions and calculations are required to get to
pretty graphs showing solar and (actual) wind production.
</p>
<p style="width:80%">
In contrast, on this page you'll find only straight data without modeling.
This means no pretty graph of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions saved, since we can't
really tell. This site however can function as an alternate look on the output of
opaque models - if things are looking good here as well (from a renewables
perspective), they probably are good.

<p>The graph above shows known sources of Dutch electricity production.
  Surprisingly, <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/dutch-electrical-power-figures-2/">a lot of unreported generation is going
  on</a>. This
  includes almost all solar electricity, plus tons of wind turbines and <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogeneration">combined heat &amp;
  power</a> production. These are not in the graph.</p>

<p>This is a complicated graph, but it offers a lot of information.
  Countries produce electricity, but there is also transmission between
  countries. This graph starts with calculating net imports or exports, and
  that is the red line in the plot.</p>
<p>
  If energy is being imported, the red line is above the x-axis, and in that
  case the graph is pretty straightforward: it shows all non-renewable
  electricity production in the country, plus everything imported.
</p>
<p>
  If energy is being exported, things are a bit more complicated. An example
  may help. If we export 3000 MW of electrical power, while 4000 MW of power
  is produced by non-renewable means, this means the "national" non-renewable
  production was 1000 MW. The rest was sold abroad.
</p>
<p>
  If however we export 4000 MW of electrical power, but only generate 2000 MW
  non-renewably, this means we can confidently claim that all our own
  electrical needs were satisfied renewably. When this happens, there is empty
  space between the power plot and the x-axis.
</p>
<p>
  The area above the x-axis is for Dutch national consumption. Anything
  below the x-axis is for exports.

<p>This is the 'non-renewable <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_curve">duck curve</a>', showing for
the past week how coal, gas, nuclear, waste and 'other' power production for
national use developed. The graph 'dips' if there is wind or if the sun
shines.</p>

The Netherlands has interconnectors to Norway, Denmark, Germany, Belgium and
the UK. Over these connectors flow gigawatts of energy. Often that power is
merely transiting The Netherlands. The 'Total' line however shows how much
electricity we are consuming from the world, or conversely, exporting to it.
